Last Updated: September 14, 2025
1. Introduction
PaxMoney (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and safeguards your information. By using PaxMoney, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
2. Data We Collect
We collect the following types of data to provide the application’s functionality:
Contact Information: When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and profile picture (if signing in via Google).
Financial Information: You voluntarily input data regarding your investment portfolios, including:
Asset tickers (Stocks, FIIs, Crypto, Fixed Income)
Quantities, prices, transaction dates
Corporate actions (splits, mergers, spin-offs)
Dividend history
Subscription Data: We collect purchase receipts and transaction identifiers provided by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store) solely to validate your Premium or Lifetime access status. We do not collect or store credit card numbers, banking details, or payment credentials.
User Content: If you use the “Import” feature, you may upload PDF files or images (such as brokerage statements). These files are temporarily processed to extract transaction data.
Identifiers: We collect a unique User ID and Device ID to manage authentication, account state, and subscription entitlements.
Usage Data: We collect aggregated or pseudonymous usage data (such as screens visited and features used) to improve performance and reliability via Google Analytics for Firebase.
3. How We Use Your Data
App Functionality: To store your portfolios, calculate performance metrics (Profit/Loss, Yield, Internal Rate of Return), and sync data across your devices using Google Firebase.
Premium Access: To verify subscription status and unlock premium features such as Unlimited Assets and Advanced Analytics.
Shared Dashboards: If you explicitly use the "Joint Dashboard" feature, your data is used to display a combined portfolio view only to the specific users you have invited. You may revoke this access at any time.
AI Features: If you upload documents or request forecasts, the specific data required for that task (image data or dividend history) is processed using Google Gemini AI. AI-generated outputs may contain inaccuracies and should be reviewed before use.
Market Data: We use asset ticker symbols to fetch public market prices from third-party financial data providers. Your personal identity is never shared with these providers.
4. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with essential service providers:
Google Firebase: For authentication, database storage, and hosting.
Google Gemini (AI): For processing text/image recognition and generating financial summaries.
Financial Data APIs: Such as CoinGecko, Brapi, TwelveData, EODHD, Alpha Vantage (ticker symbols only).
Other Users (Joint Dashboard): If you invite another user to a Joint Dashboard, you explicitly consent to share only the portfolio data included in that dashboard with that user. Access can be revoked at any time.
5. Data Retention and Deletion
Retention: We retain your data for as long as your account remains active.
Account Deletion: You may delete your account and all associated data at any time directly within the app (Settings → Personal Details → Delete Account). Upon confirmation, your data is permanently removed from our systems.
6. Children’s Privacy
PaxMoney is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
